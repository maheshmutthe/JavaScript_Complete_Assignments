Day1

 1)Difference Between Let, and Var

-> Scope of let is BLock level and Var cha Functional Scope
    var can be rdeclare  and let cannot be redeclare(if we use same variable in var it 
	creates object of respective type of data but it is not the dame case with let)
   

2)Difference and similarities Between Let, and  Const

-> Const has compulsion to define and initilize in same line
   whereas let can be initilize and declare in different line

   both have block level scope(similaraties)


3)why to use 'use strict'

-> to do Programming safely



4)what is the use of Typeof

-> it gives the datatype of class


5)Which operator is overloaded

-> + operator is overloaded.

6)What is the default value if variable is not assign any value.

->undefined.

7)Calculation between number and Undefined results into

->NaN(Not a number)

8)What is the default value returned by function.

->undefined

9)Explain following line  window.document.write()

-> window is ref of Window class and document is reference of Document class which is child 
	of Windoew class and write is method Document class.


10)Is java script object oriented?

-> yes it is object oriented.

11)List down predefined references [Object] in JS

-> document,window.

12)Which version you have learned?

->js6.

13)Why Js is called client side?

->Source code is process by client side. 

14)is java script Dynamic? explain with examples.
->yes.  
    ex-  a=5 ;
    document.write(a); //it will print 5  how? it will resolves at runtime that datatupe of a is number
          

15)In java script parameter in function call and parameter in defination need to be same?

->no


16)do we need to terminate statement using semicolon ; in JS
-> not compulsory.

17)use of javascript?

->its main purpose is client side validation.

18)Tell me the frame works or libraries  build using JS

->Node.Js,Vue.js,React are framework
  Jquery And react library

19)How to get count of the given string.

->match function.


20)what is valueOf() in which class it is defined.

-> javaScript calls the valueOf method to convert an object to a primitive value.
valueOf() will give you value within data.
    It resides in Object class


Day 2

 1)what is difference between call and apply?

->The call() method takes arguments separately.

 The apply() method takes arguments as an array.


2)how to declare instance method in class?

-> An instance method is a function which is part of a class, and acts on an instance of that class.
    


3)When you print object inernaly it will call which method

->tostring()

4)what is difference between of and in key word

-> in: this keyword print key-value pair present in array 
   of: this keyword print undefined in place where element not present in array

5)what is difference between push unshift

->push:  add element at end of array
  unshift: add the element at beginnning of array


6)what is difference betwee pop shift

-> pop: remove element at the end of array
   shift: remove element from beginning in array


7)what is difference between find and filter

-> find: it returns the value of first element in provided  array that satisfies the provided testing function. 
         if no value satisfy the provided testing function it return undefined 

   filter(): it creates the new array with all element that passes the test implemented by provided function

 8)what is splice and slice

-> slice: it cuts the array from given index and does not modify original array .we can also specify start
	 index and end index then from start index to excluding last index it cuts array

	part of the array copy from one to another array (here size is index)

   splice:it is use to add element from specified index and given element in syntax  and remove element from specified index 
		(Modifies original array)
		add and remove 
		fruits.splice(1,3) removes from 1 to 3
		fruits.splice(2,0,"lemon","banana") add from 2
		(start, remove) 


9)How to convert array to string?

->join("_") is used to convert array to string (if no parameter pass then element are seperated by , it bcome string)



10)explain three different ways to create object in JS

->There are four ways to create an object in JavaScript - 
  using object literals, 
  using the function constructor, 
  using the Object.create() method,
  and using the class keyword (which is almost the same as using a function constructor)



11)Why Js is called Client side

->   Client-side means that the action takes place on the user's (the client's) computer. 
      Server-side means that the action takes place on a web server.

     JavaScript is a client-side language, which means it gets executed at the client side (i.e, user side). 
     Whenever you browse the web, all the HTML,CSS & JS files are fetched from the server & then
	 executed/interpreted at your side by your browser.




12)explain call back  and self invoking function

->self invoking function is used when we have a scenario that something get printed or initialized  
	as soon as the page gets laoded.
   
  call back function is when we pass parameter in function call as function defination 
   
<script>

      var go=function(w)
	{
             alert(w(5));    //w is pointing to anonymous funxction and this concept is called as callback
           }

     go(function(a) {
         return a*a*a
           }
          )
</script>


13)
sort --> sortd the data
v8 chrome machine browser --> quick or insertion sort (for small array)
firefox : merge sort
safari: quick merge or insertion (depends on condition)

find --> return the 1st which satisfies the condition

filter --> return all which satisfies the condition

at --> return the value at index (- or + position)

fill --> The fill() method fills specified elements in an array with a value.
	The fill() method overwrites the original array.
	Start and end position can be specified. If not, all elements will be filled.
	array.fill(value, start, end)	

14)
include --> The includes() method returns true if a string contains a specified string.
Otherwise it returns false.
The includes() method is case sensitive.


pop --> removes from top
shift --> removes from bottom
unshift --> adding data at bottom
push --> add the top
reverse --> modify original data to change data in reverse



literal vs constuctor object
-->
The constructor object has its properties and methods defined with the keyword 'this' in front of it, whereas the literal version does not.
In the constructor object the properties/methods have their 'values' defined after an equal sign '=' whereas in the literal version, 
they are defined after a colon ':'.
The constructor function can have (optional) semi-colons ';' at the end of each property/method declaration whereas in the literal
 version if you have more than one property or method, they MUST be separated with
a comma ',', and they CANNOT have semi-colons after them, 
otherwise JavaScript will return an error.

You can create multiple object for constructor object
You create only one object in literal object. Just for display and temporary use.
single object in literal and multiple in constuctor



Day4

whats is difference between function as class and class key word
--> 'use strict' to use functionas as a class while in case of class keyword doesnt need use 'use strict' keyword'
	inhertitance in function as a class is old style of prototype has to use and in only class we use through 
		extends with less and easy syntax
	function as a class is enumrable where class isn't.
	when we use function as a class for inherited property we have type prototype keyword when we use class 
		keyword we dont have to write
 
Prototype-based programming 
--> Prototype-based programming is a style of object-oriented programming in which classes are not explicitly 
defined, but rather derived by adding properties and methods to an instance of another class or, 
less frequently, adding them to an empty object.
In simple words: this type of style allows the creation of an object without first defining its class.

--> checks the object type returns boolean value.

why we need getter setter in JS , list down predefine getter setter
--> Getter for Dispaying or by progammer side adding the value and Setter for accepting value or confirmation 
	For modifying object as per need
	setter -- Current(accepts the element at current position), prop(to bind the given function ())
			innerHTML ->  The JavaScript innerHTML property sets the HTML contents of an element on a web page.

	getter -- Latest(Displays add latest element)
	

All exception are derived from which class
--> Error

what is difference between console.log , document.write‌,innerHTML
--> Console.log prints on Console
	documents.write print on browser screen
	innerHTML ->  The JavaScript innerHTML property sets the HTML contents of an element on a web page.

what is bind method?
--> In JavaScript function binding happens using Bind() method. With this method, we can bind an object 
to a common function, so that the function gives different result when needed. otherwise it gives the same
 result or gives an error while the code is executing.
We use the Bind() method to call a function with the this value, this keyword refers to the same object 
which is currently selected . In other words, bind() method allows us to easily set which object will be 
bound by the this keyword when a function or method is invoked

can we change getter setter name?

how to open a file in new window
--> window.open(URL, '_blank');


difference between alert and prompt
--> 1. Alert box :
	An alert box is one type of popup boxes in JavaScript which is often used to make sure that information have 
	come through the user. So, the user will have to click “OK” to proceed when an alert box pops up on the window.

	2. Prompt box :
	It is also one of the type of popup boxes in JavaScript which is often to take input a value before entering a page 
	from the user. To proceed after entering an input value in the prompt, the user will have to click either “OK” or “Cancel”.


use of confirm and what is its return value[Ok cancel]
--> The confirm() method displays a dialog box with a message, an OK button, and a Cancel button.
	The confirm() method returns true if the user clicked "OK", otherwise false.
