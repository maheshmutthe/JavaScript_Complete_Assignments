how to covert array to string
join 
string any ("-") ("") 

type of paratmeter??



initial size to 5 ??
new Array(5) onto heap and control goes to constructor

accaept sny length further because itis dynamic

betterway of array
var arr = [   ]		(because dynamic accept any data)

let ob={name:"raj", age: 25}
let ob2=ob (Shallow copy)


slice--> part of the array copy from one to another array (here size is index)

pop --> removes from top
shift --> removes from bottom
unshift --> adding data at bottom
push --> add the top
reverse --> modify original data to change data in reverse


splice --> modify original array
--> add and remove 
fruits.splice(1,3) removes from 1 to 3
fruits.splice(2,0,"lemon","banana") add from 2
(start, remove) 

sort --> sortd the data
v8 chrome machine browser --> quick or insertion sort (for small array)
firefox : merge sort
safari: quick merge or insertion (depends on condition)

find --> return the 1st which satisfies the condition

filter --> return all which satisfies the condition

at --> return the value at index (- or + position)

fill --> The fill() method fills specified elements in an array with a value.
	The fill() method overwrites the original array.
	Start and end position can be specified. If not, all elements will be filled.
	array.fill(value, start, end)



include --> The includes() method returns true if a string contains a specified string.
Otherwise it returns false.
The includes() method is case sensitive.

====oop====

object

function is class and constructor also
this --> current object
alert --> popup
this is compulsory
by default member of the class public

literal vs constuctor object
-->
The constructor object has its properties and methods defined with the keyword 'this' in front of it, whereas the literal version does not.
In the constructor object the properties/methods have their 'values' defined after an equal sign '=' whereas in the literal version, 
they are defined after a colon ':'.
The constructor function can have (optional) semi-colons ';' at the end of each property/method declaration whereas in the literal
 version if you have more than one property or method, they MUST be separated witha comma ',', and they CANNOT have semi-colons after them, 
otherwise JavaScript will return an error.

You can create multiple object for constructor object
You create only one object in literal object. Just for display and temporary use.
single object in literal and multiple in constuctor
